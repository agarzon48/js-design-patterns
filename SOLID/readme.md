# HOW TO USE THIS FOLDER

`solid.md` file contains some general information about SOLID principles.

You can extend that information in each principle's file.

There are also examples in `JS` and `TS` inside their corresponding folders. Each folder has two files: a bad example, where the principle is violated, and a good example, where the violation has been solved.
